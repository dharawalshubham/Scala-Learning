// TUPLES in scala
// A tuple is a neat class that gives you a simple way to store heterogeneous
// (different) items in the same container.
// Scala tuples can contain between two and 22 items, and they’re
// useful for those times when you just need to combine a few things
// together
// Technically, Scala 2.x tuples aren’t collections classes, they’re
// just a convenient little container. Because they aren’t a
// collection, they don’t have methods like map, filter, etc.
// Tuples are also immutable
