// Important pillar of OOP(Object Oriented Programming)
// Inheritance in scala-
// It is the mechanism in Scala by which one class is allowed to inherit the
// features(fields and methods) of another class.

// Super Class: The class whose features are inherited is known as superclass.
// (or a base class or a parent class).

// Sub Class: The class that inherits the other class is known as subclass
// (or a derived class . The subclass can add its own fields and methods
// in addition to the superclass fields and methods.

// Reusability: Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”, i.e. when
// we want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes
// some of the code that we want, we can derive our new class from the 
// existing class. By doing this, we are reusing the fields and methods
// of the existing class.
